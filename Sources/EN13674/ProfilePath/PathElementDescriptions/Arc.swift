///
/// The arc description may consist of several boudary conditions. Where an arc can be uniquely described
/// by a start end end angle, a direction and a radius, it may be good enough to give less information.
/// ``Arc`` allows a client to do so, and relies on the ``PathBuilder`` to generate the path out of it.
/// Therefore, an ``Arc`` description can't be 'incomplete' only within the context given by the other Path elements
/// it may be insufficient to be uniquely defined, which may prevent rendering.
